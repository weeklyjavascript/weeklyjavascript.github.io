## privacy policy

weekly.js is determined to protect and maintain your privacy. We are privileged to be trusted with your personal information and do not wish to jeopardize that trust.

However, in order to use some of our services, it’s necessary for you to give us details such as your name and email address or, potentially, your street address, and we will ask your permission for these details where relevant.

Please note that we do NOT store credit/debit card numbers, nor do we share customer details with any 3rd parties.

This document explains how and why we collect information from our users, how we use it, and how you can access or change it. This document does not cover third-party sites we link to or which link to us. Those sites should have their own privacy policies.

If you have any problem with this policy or wish to ask questions, please contact us on team@weeklyjavascript.news

### what information we collect

On our site(s), there are pages where you will be requested to enter private information in order to receive specific benefits of information in response. This data may include your name, email address, and street address.

If you are signing up to a paid service from us, we (or our payment provider) may additionally request your billing information, such as card details and billing address.

We also may use cookies on our site(s) in order to track your particular ‘session’ on our site. This is not used for contextual advertising purposes and, in general, is not directly traceable to you.

We use Google Analytics on some of our sites in order to track the number of visitors, how those visitors came to our site, and which pages those visitors visit on our site(s). This is all handled under Google’s privacy policy.

### what we do with your information

We may use your information in order to track your relationship with us and our site(s) as well as to send you emails about information you have requested or other information or promotions specifically relevant to weekly.js and its activities. Essentially, your data will only be used for the specific purposes for which it was collected (as per the Data Protection Act 1998 (UK)).

We may, occasionally, send surveys or even direct one-to-one mail in order to manage our customer service processes.

We do NOT share your information with third parties, we do NOT share your email addresses with sponsors or any third parties, and we do NOT run exclusive ‘sponsored’ emails on behalf of third parties. We may, however, have sponsors or advertisers for emails you would otherwise be choosing to receive but will not send mails specifically for the purpose of advertising third parties or their products.

Please note that we do not store credit/debit card numbers nor do we share customer details with any 3rd parties.

Information will not be disclosed to other parties without the consent of the individual whom it is about, unless there is legislation or other overriding legitimate reason to share the information (for example, the prevention or detection of crime).
